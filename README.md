# UCD ChestX-ray14 effort

## Getting Started
If you are using lakota then pytorch comes pre-built with anaconda. You can activate it yourself using

    source activate pytorch

Afterwards you can use all software normally. If you are not using lakota then you will have to setup your
pytorch libraries yourself. You can do this by using the pytorch site for instructions. Once you have finished
setting up pytorch run setup.py.

    python setup.py develop

After this all cxr common libraries should be good for use.
